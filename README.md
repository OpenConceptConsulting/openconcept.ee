# OpenConcept Consulting (Europe) OÃœ

[OpenConcept Consulting Inc.'s](https://openconcept.ca) European Office. We are hoping to expand to do more business in Europe, but are also looking to explore in a very practical sense how the Estonia has built their Open Government framework. 


## Open Source 

OpenConcept has been working in Canada with open source and open standards for nearly 20 years. These two elements provide the foundation for open government. Without building a culture of openness & sharing, open government will just be a buzzword. 

## Drupal

The bulk of OpenConcept's experience with openness comes from our leadership in the Drupal community. [Mike Gifford](https://www.drupal.org/u/mgifford) in particular has provided leadership by spearheading various initiatives, such as the one to improve Drupal's accessibility.
