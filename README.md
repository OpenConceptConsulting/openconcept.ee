## OpenConcept Consulting (Europe) OÜ

[OpenConcept Consulting Inc.'s](https://openconcept.ca) European Office. We are an internet strategy company that provides critical insights into how to leverage open source communities. By having a base in Europe we are hoping to provide guidance to institutions struggling to meet security, accessibility & privacy requirements. We are based in Estonia because their e-Residecy program provides an effective platform to explore working with a digital first, open government. 

### Strategy

Unlike our Canadian sister company, OpenConcept.ee is not a development shop. OpenConcept Consulting (Europe) OÜ focuses on how to engage the community behind the open source technology stack you use to see that your meet your legal and moral institutional goals. The modern world depends on open frameworks, but our institutions haven't kept up. 

### Open Government

Citizens don't really care about open government, but they do to have the services that they need delivered to them in a timely & effective manner. Open government is a means to address this that is built on sharing, transparency, and evidence based decision making. 

### Open Source

OpenConcept has been working in Canada with open source and open standards for nearly 20 years. These two elements provide the foundation for open government. Without building a culture of openness & sharing, open government will just be a buzzword. 

### Drupal

The bulk of OpenConcept's experience with openness comes from our leadership in the [Drupal community](https://drupal.org). [Mike Gifford](https://www.drupal.org/u/mgifford) in particular has provided leadership by spearheading various initiatives, such as the one to improve Drupal's accessibility. 

Our sister company, [OpenConcept.ca](https://OpenConcept.ca) can take care of your Drupal hosting, development and support work.
